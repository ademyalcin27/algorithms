# Merged Sorting Algorithm
## _The Last Markdown Editor, Ever_
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows :
Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
